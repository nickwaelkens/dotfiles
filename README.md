Dotfiles
========

> Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine.

## Todo
* Figure out how to add a decent theme with current git branch, status etc.
* Automatically install Homebrew if not installed yet
* Automatically set zsh as default shell
* Fix Homebrew cask installations (permissions issues)

## Thanks

These dotfiles are forked from the amazing [Zach Holman](http://github.com/holman/dotfiles) and adapted to my hearts content.
